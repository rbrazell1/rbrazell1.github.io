### Professional Summary
As a Union Pipe Welder I learned the importance of paying attention to detail and the importance 
of hard work. I'm no stranger to learning new skills very quickly, which lead me to the decision 
to change industries by attending a Java Bootcamp at Central New Mexico Community College and
becoming a software engineer. I'm certain I have the fundamental skills needed to add productive
value _immediately_ and the drive to learn everything that's needed to rise to the next level time 
and time again.
